interAppPDAudio
===============
#### This Project demos the CSAudioController, which can be used to make libPd Apps compatible with Apple's inter-app audio system.  
It is assumed that you are familiar with libPD and how to set up a libPD App in xCode.  
If you are not, please refer to the book __'Making musical Apps'__ by Peter Brinkmann. 
  
I also strongly recommend watching the video 602 __'What's new in CoreAudio'__ from the __WWDC2013__.  
Please also download and try out the _InterAppAudioSuite_, which is available as Apple sample code.  
The InterAppAudioHost from this Suite is necessary to try all aspects of inter-App audio functionality!  

####Project setup:
* clone this repository  
* initialise and update git submodules
